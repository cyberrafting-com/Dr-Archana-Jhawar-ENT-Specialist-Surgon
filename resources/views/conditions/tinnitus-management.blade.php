                    <h2>What is Tinnitus?</h2>
                    <div class="single-item-service">
                        <p>Tinnitus is a condition characterized by a continuous ringing or buzzing sound in the ears.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="space-top"></div>
                    <h2>Causes</h2>
                    <div class="single-item-service">
                        <p>Tinnitus can be triggered by various factors, including exposure to loud noises, age-related hearing loss, earwax blockage, and certain medical conditions such as Meniere's disease or temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="space-top"></div>
                    <h2>Symptoms</h2>
                    <div class="single-item-service">
                        <p>The most common symptom of Tinnitus is the perception of noise when there is no external sound source. This noise can manifest as ringing, buzzing, hissing, or roaring, and it may be intermittent or constant.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="space-top"></div>
                    <h2>Risk Factors</h2>
                    <div class="single-item-service">
                        <p>Prolonged exposure to loud noises, a history of ear Tinnitus, cardiovascular issues, and certain medications, such as antibiotics and high doses of aspirin, can increase the likelihood of experiencing Tinnitus.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="space-top"></div>
                    <h2>When to see an ENT Specialist</h2>
                    <div class="single-item-service">
                        <p>While occasional Tinnitus is common and often temporary, persistent symptoms require medical attention. If you experience Tinnitus along with hearing loss, and dizziness, or if it interferes with your daily chores, it's important to consult with an ENT Specialist.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="space-top"></div>
                    <h2>Treatment</h2>
                    <div class="single-item-service">
                        <p>Lifestyle changes, like avoiding loud noises and managing stress, can contribute to symptom relief. For some, however, medical interventions or therapeutic strategies may be necessary.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="space-top"></div>
                    <h2>Sound Therapy and Music Therapy</h2>
                    <div class="single-item-service">
                        <p>Sound therapy involves using external sounds to mask or partially suppress the tinnitus noise. White noise machines, hearing aids, or wearable sound generators are common devices used in sound therapy. These tools can help distract the brain from the tinnitus sound and provide relief to some individuals.</p>
                        <p>Music therapy is an approach in which the herapists use specially designed music or sounds to help patients shift their focus away from the Tinnitus. This form of therapy can enhance mood, reduce stress, and improve overall well-being.</p>

                    <div class="space-top"></div>
                    <h2>Prevention</h2>
                    <div class="single-item-service">
                        <p>Protecting your hearing is a key preventive measure against Tinnitus. This includes using ear protection in noisy environments, limiting exposure to loud music or machinery, and managing stress through relaxation techniques like yoga or meditation. Regular check-ups with an audiologist can also help detect and address hearing issues early on.</p>
