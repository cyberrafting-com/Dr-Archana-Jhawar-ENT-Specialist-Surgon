                        <p>Snoring, often dismissed as a harmless nuisance, can sometimes be indicative of a more severe condition â€“ Obstructive Sleep apnea (OSA). OSA, characterized by recurrent pauses in breathing during sleep, poses significant health risks. These pauses can last for seconds to many minutes and may occur several times throughout the night. OSA not only disrupts the sleep cycle but can also leads to many health issues, including cardiovascular problems, diabetes, and impaired cognitive function.</p>
