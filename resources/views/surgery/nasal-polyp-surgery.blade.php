                    <div class="single-item-service">
                        <p>Nasal polyp surgery, also called polypectomy, is a surgical procedure performed to remove nasal polypsâ€”soft, noncancerous growths that can develop on the lining of the nasal passages or sinuses. These growths often result in symptoms such as nasal congestion, difficulty breathing, loss of smell, and recurrent sinus infections.</p>

                        <i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i><p class="para">Most nasal polyp surgeries are conducted endoscopically. The surgeon uses a thin, flexible tube with a light and camera (endoscope) to visualize and access the nasal passages.</p>
                        <i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i><p class="para">The surgeon uses specialized instruments to carefully remove the nasal polyps. The goal is to clear the nasal passages and sinuses to improve airflow and alleviate symptoms.</p>

                        <p>Nasal polyp surgery aims to relieve symptoms associated with nasal polyps, such as congestion, difficulty breathing, and sinus infections. By removing the polyps, the surgery can improve nasal airflow and restore the sense of smell.</p>
