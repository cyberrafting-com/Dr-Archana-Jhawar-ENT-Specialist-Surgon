                    <div class="single-item-service">
                        <p>Tympanoplasty, also known as the repair of a ruptured eardrum, is a surgical procedure performed to restore the integrity of the tympanic membrane (eardrum). This surgery is typically performed to address issues related to a perforated eardrum, which can result from various causes such as infections, trauma, or chronic ear disease.</p>

                    <h2>Procedure Details</h2>
                    <div class="single-item-service">
                        <p>Before undergoing tympanoplasty, patients undergo a comprehensive evaluation by their ENT Specialist. The procedure is often carried out under general anesthesia, although local anesthesia may be an option in certain cases.</p>
                        <i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i><p class="para">During tympanoplasty, the surgeon reaches the middle ear through the ear canal or by making a small incision behind the ear.</p>
                        <i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i><p class="para">The torn or damaged eardrum is carefully repaired using a graft, which may be taken from the patient's own tissue or from synthetic materials.</p>
                        <i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i><p class="para">An airtight seal is created, restoring the barrier function of the eardrum.</p>

                        <p>The risks may include infection, hearing loss, dizziness, or failure of the graft to heal properly. It's crucial for patients to discuss potential risks and benefits with their doctor before deciding to undergo the procedure.</p>

                    <div class="single-item-service">
                        <p>Recovery after tympanoplasty varies from person to person, but many individuals can resume normal activities within a few days to weeks. Patients are usually suggested to avoid activities that could introduce water into the ear, such as swimming, during the initial stages of recovery.</p>
                        <p>Follow-up appointments are essential to monitor the healing process and assess the success of the tympanoplasty. Patients may also need to refrain from air travel and certain water-related activities for a specified period to ensure proper healing.</p>

Follow-up appointments are crucial to monitor progress and address any concerns.</p>
